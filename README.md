# webpack-basics
This branch deals with the creation of webpack and configuring in package.json and bundling the output in bundle.js of dist folder
Here we used only file protocol, not http protocol.
Typically bundle.js is not served from server.
So in next branch the js are served from server and we can even get rid of bundle.js in development setup
